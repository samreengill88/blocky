# Blocky
Blocky is a turn-based strategy game where players manipulate a hierarchical game board to achieve the highest score based on specific goals. The game emphasizes recursive operations, tree modeling, and algorithm design.


## Features
- Players can perform various mutating and non-mutating actions on the blocks, such as rotate, smash and paint
- Goals:
  - Perimeter goal: Optimize the number of colored blocks on the board's perimeter.
  - Blob goal: Create the largest connected blob of a specific color
- Players alternate performing moves on the game board.

## Example
#### For the following board with maximum depth level 3, Player 2’s goal is to create the largest blob for the Old Olive colour. Player 2’s score for this blob goal is 26.
