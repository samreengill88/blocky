    """A square Block in the Blocky game, represented as a tree.

    In addition to its tree-related attributes, a Block also contains attributes
    that describe how the Block appears on a Cartesian plane. All positions
    describe the upper left corner (x, y), and the origin is at (0, 0). All
    positions and sizes are in the unit of pixels.

    When a block has four children, the order of its children impacts each
    child's position. Indices 0, 1, 2, and 3 are the upper-right child,
    upper-left child, lower-left child, and lower-right child, respectively.

    Attributes
    - position: The (x, y) coordinates of the upper left corner of this Block.
    - size: The height and width of this square Block.
    - colour: If this block is not subdivided, <colour> stores its colour.
              Otherwise, <colour> is None.
    - level: The level of this block within the overall block structure.
             The outermost block, corresponding to the root of the tree,
             is at level zero. If a block is at level i, its children are at
             level i+1.
    - max_depth: The deepest level allowed in the overall block structure.
    - children: The blocks into which this block is subdivided. The children are
                stored in this order: upper-right child, upper-left child,
                lower-left child, lower-right child.

    Representation Invariants:
    - self.level <= self.max_depth
    - len(self.children) == 0 or len(self.children) == 4
    - If this Block has children:
        - their max_depth is the same as that of this Block.
        - their size is half that of this Block.
        - their level is one greater than that of this Block.
        - their position is determined by the position and size of this Block,
          and their index in this Block's list of children.
        - this Block's colour is None.
    - If this Block has no children:
        - its colour is not None.

            `level` is the level of this child `Block`, then the child `Block`
            will be smashed.
        - If the child `Block` is not smashed, uniform randomly assign the child
            a color from the list of colours in `settings.COLOUR_LIST`.

        If this Block's level is <max_depth>, do nothing. If this block has
